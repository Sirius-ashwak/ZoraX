# Quick Fix for White Screen - Onboarding Debug

## The Issue
You're seeing a white screen because the onboarding flow might not be triggered properly. This can happen if:

1. **Onboarding is marked as completed** - The app thinks you've already seen it
2. **Missing component exports** - Some onboarding screens weren't exported properly
3. **App state issues** - The app isn't checking onboarding status correctly

## Quick Fixes

### 1. Reset Onboarding State
Open your browser's **Developer Tools Console** (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Reset onboarding state
localStorage.removeItem('credvault-onboarding-completed');
console.log('Onboarding state reset!');

// Check current state
console.log('Onboarding completed:', localStorage.getItem('credvault-onboarding-completed'));

// Refresh the page
window.location.reload();
```

### 2. Force Onboarding Mode
If that doesn't work, try this in the console:

```javascript
// Force show onboarding
localStorage.setItem('credvault-onboarding-completed', 'false');
window.location.reload();
```

### 3. Check for Errors
Look in the **Console tab** for any red error messages. Common issues:
- Import/export errors
- Missing components
- TypeScript compilation errors

## What I Just Fixed

I recreated the missing `OnboardingScreen2.tsx` file that was causing import errors. The onboarding should now work properly.

## Expected Behavior

After running the reset commands above, you should see:

1. **Screen 1**: Welcome to CredVault with feature icons
2. **Screen 2**: Split view showing Creator vs Supporter benefits  
3. **Screen 3**: Call-to-action with wallet connection

## Navigation Options

Once the onboarding appears, you can:
- **Click progress dots** at the top to jump between screens
- **Use arrow keys** (← →) to navigate
- **Press ESC** to skip onboarding
- **Click Next/Previous** buttons at the bottom
- **Click Skip** button in top-right corner

## If Still Seeing White Screen

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Clear browser cache** and reload
3. **Try incognito/private browsing** mode
4. **Verify the dev server is running** at `http://localhost:5173`

Let me know what you see in the console after trying these steps!
