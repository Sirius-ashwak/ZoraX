## Project Overview

### Project Name
**CredVault**

### Tagline
*"Where Creator Credibility Meets Supporter Discovery"*

### Team Information
- **Team Name**: CredVault Team
- **Team Size**: 1 Developer (Mohamed)
- **Location**: [Your Location]
- **Contact**: mohamed@credvault.io

### Project Description
CredVault is a comprehensive creator-supporter platform that revolutionizes the creator economy by introducing transparent reputation systems built on Zora's infrastructure. We solve two critical problems: creators struggle to build credibility, and supporters struggle to discover quality projects before they become mainstream.

Our platform combines Zora CoinV4 token deployment, innovative ZoraCred reputation scoring, and viral Farcaster Frame integration to create a seamless ecosystem where trust is transparent and success is amplified.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Creator Credibility Crisis
- **No Reputation System**: Creators start from zero with each new project
- **Trust Barriers**: Supporters can't verify creator track records
- **Discovery Friction**: Quality creators get lost in platform noise
- **Limited Social Reach**: Difficult to achieve viral distribution

### The Supporter Discovery Problem  
- **Information Asymmetry**: No way to verify creator reliability
- **FOMO Risk**: Missing early access to successful projects
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Scattered across multiple platforms
- **Social Proof Absence**: No clear indicators of project quality

### Market Opportunity
The creator economy is valued at **$104 billion** and growing rapidly. However, existing platforms lack:
1. Transparent reputation systems
2. Viral social distribution mechanisms  
3. Seamless Web3 integration
4. Creator-supporter relationship optimization

---

### Core Innovation: ZoraCred Reputation System
**Transparent, verifiable creator credibility scores based on on-chain activity**

- **Multi-Metric Scoring**: Volume (40%), Supporters (25%), Consistency (20%), Engagement (15%)
- **Reputation Tiers**: Newcomer → Rising Star → Established → Elite → Legend
- **Achievement Badges**: Early Adopter, High Volume, Community Favorite, etc.
- **Dynamic Aura**: Visual reputation indicators that enhance profile appeal

### Seamless Campaign Management
**One-click Zora CoinV4 deployment with comprehensive creator tools**

- **Instant Deployment**: Deploy NFT campaigns in under 2 minutes
- **Flexible Pricing**: Support various campaign types and pricing models

```

### Zora Protocol Integration
**Deep integration with Zora's infrastructure for reliable NFT operations**

```typescript
// Zora CoinV4 Deployment
const deployZoraCoin = async (campaignData: CampaignData) => {
  const zoraCoinFactory = new ethers.Contract(
    ZORA_COIN_FACTORY_ADDRESS,
    zoraCoinFactoryABI,
    signer
  );
  
  const tx = await zoraCoinFactory.create({
    name: campaignData.title,
    symbol: generateSymbol(campaignData.title),
    totalSupply: campaignData.maxSupply,
    price: parseEther(campaignData.price),
    creator: campaignData.creator
  });
  
  return tx.wait();
};
```

### Smart Contract Architecture
**Built on proven Zora infrastructure with custom reputation logic**

```solidity
contract CredVault {
    struct Campaign {
        address creator;
        address tokenAddress;
        uint256 price;
        uint256 maxSupply;
        uint256 currentSupply;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Campaign) public campaigns;
    mapping(address => uint256[]) public creatorCampaigns;
    
    event CampaignCreated(uint256 indexed campaignId, address indexed creator);
    event SupporterMint(uint256 indexed campaignId, address indexed supporter);
}
```

### Reputation Algorithm
**Transparent, fair scoring system with anti-gaming mechanisms**

```typescript
const calculateZoraCred = (creator: CreatorData): number => {
  const volumeScore = Math.min(creator.totalVolume * 10, 400); // Max 400 points
  const supporterScore = Math.min(creator.uniqueSupporters * 2, 250); // Max 250 points  
  const consistencyScore = creator.campaignCount > 0 ? 
    (creator.successfulCampaigns / creator.campaignCount) * 200 : 0; // Max 200 points
  const engagementScore = Math.min(creator.socialMetrics * 0.1, 150); // Max 150 points
  
  return Math.min(volumeScore + supporterScore + consistencyScore + engagementScore, 1000);
};
```
