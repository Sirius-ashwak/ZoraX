# CSS Performance Optimizations Applied

## Browser Compatibility Fixes
- ✅ Added `-webkit-text-size-adjust`, `-ms-text-size-adjust`, and `text-size-adjust` for text scaling
- ✅ Added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` alongside `backdrop-filter` for Safari support
- ✅ Added `-webkit-line-clamp` alongside `line-clamp` for better browser support
- ✅ Added `-webkit-user-select` alongside `user-select` for Safari support
- ✅ Fixed display properties order (`display: -webkit-box` before `display: flex`)

## Performance Improvements
- ✅ Optimized keyframe animations to use `transform` instead of layout-triggering properties
- ✅ Reduced particle count from 20 to 12 in onboarding animation
- ✅ Added `will-change: transform` for animated elements
- ✅ Used `easeInOut` instead of `linear` for smoother animations
- ✅ Added staggered animation delays to reduce simultaneous repaints

## Security Headers
- ✅ Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` meta tag
- ✅ Added basic Content Security Policy
- ✅ Added `color-scheme` and `theme-color` meta tags

## Accessibility
- ✅ Custom scrollbar styling for WebKit browsers
- ✅ Proper contrast ratios maintained in animations
- ✅ Reduced motion preferences respected (can be extended)

## Notes
- Autoprefixer is configured in PostCSS to handle remaining vendor prefixes
- Tailwind CSS handles most utility classes with proper prefixes
- Animation performance is optimized for 60fps on most devices
- GPU acceleration is selectively applied to avoid memory issues

## Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)
- Some properties like `forced-color-adjust` are intentionally not prefixed (modern browsers only)
- `scrollbar-color` and `scrollbar-width` are Firefox-specific and work as intended
- CSP warnings are expected for development mode with eval

## Testing
Test the app across different browsers:
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Good support with fallbacks
- Safari: Improved support with webkit prefixes
- Mobile browsers: Optimized for touch and performance
