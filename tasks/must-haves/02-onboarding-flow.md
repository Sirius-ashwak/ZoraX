## üåå Description
Design and implement a visually captivating, narrative-driven landing and onboarding experience for CredVault, deeply inspired by the design language and flow of Reflect Notes v2.

This onboarding flow should:

- Tell a story through scroll (think parallax reveal or staged sections)
- Blend motion, light, and typography to create immersion
- Drive users toward wallet connection and launch

|---------|-------------------------|--------|
| ‚ú® Hero Section | "Think better with Reflect" | Use "Build your Creator Economy with CredVault" |
| ÔøΩ Ambient Glow | Glowing lines, gradients, halos | Neon purple-blue + animated SVG effects |
| üìÑ Feature Cards | Notes, integrations, security | Use "Campaigns", "Reputation", "Supporter Benefits" |
| üîó CTA Section | "Use Reflect with other apps" + "$10/month" | Replace with "Launch Campaign" + "Free to mint" |
| üõ°Ô∏è Trust Section | "Hardened security" | Replace with "Onchain, Transparent, Immutable" |
| ü™ê Footer | Planet glow with academy links | Replace with "Explore Docs" |
