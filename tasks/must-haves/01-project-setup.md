**Priority**: Must-Have  
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Status**: âœ… Completed

## Description
Establish the foundational infrastructure for CredVault MVP, including project initialization, Web3 connectivity, and basic development environment setup.

## Sub-tasks

- [x] Configure folder structure
- [x] Set up basic health check endpoint

### 1.3 Configure Concurrent Development
- [x] Install and configure `concurrently` in root package.json
- [x] Create npm scripts for parallel frontend/backend development
- [x] Test concurrent startup

### 1.4 Set Up Basic Project Structure
- [x] Create shared types directory
- [x] Set up constants and configuration files
- [x] Create utility functions directory
- [x] Set up basic component library structure

### 1.5 Configure Web3 Wallet Connection
