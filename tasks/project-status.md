## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Zora CoinV4 Integration Complexity** - May require more time than estimated
- **Blockchain Data Fetching** - Network issues and rate limiting
- **Farcaster Frame Implementation** - New technology, potential API changes
- **Time Constraints** - Aggressive timeline for full feature set

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with Task 1 (Project Setup) immediately
- Implement core MVP features before polish
- Create fallback plans for complex integrations
- Regular progress reviews and scope adjustments

### Backup Plans
- Simplified Farcaster integration (basic sharing vs. full frames)
- Manual metrics display vs. real-time blockchain querying
- Static aura levels vs. dynamic calculations
- Focus on 1-tier campaigns initially

## Key Milestones

### 🎯 Milestone 1: Foundation Complete
- **Target**: End of Week 1
- **Criteria**: Project setup, basic onboarding, campaign creation form
- **Success Metric**: Can create and deploy a basic campaign

### 🎯 Milestone 2: Core MVP Complete  
- **Target**: End of Week 2
- **Criteria**: Full campaign lifecycle, profiles, Farcaster sharing
- **Success Metric**: End-to-end user journey works

### 🎯 Milestone 3: Integration Complete
- **Target**: End of Week 3  
- **Criteria**: All integrations working, testing complete
- **Success Metric**: Production-ready application

### 🎯 Milestone 4: Submission Ready
