   ```
   OR
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser to:** http://localhost:5173

3. **Reset onboarding state:**
   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Run this command:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.removeItem('credvault-onboarding-completed');
     location.reload();
     ```

4. **Expected Result:**
   - Page refreshes and shows onboarding flow
   - You'll see 3 beautiful onboarding screens
   - Reflect Notes inspired dark theme design

### Method 2: Manual Component Testing

**Test individual screens directly:**

1. **Screen 1 - Welcome:**
   - Headline: "Welcome to CredVault"
   - Body: "Transform your creativity into supporter communities..."
   - Dark theme with fade-in animation

2. **Screen 2 - Dual Benefits:**
   - Headline: "Built for Creators and Supporters"
   - Split layout: Creators vs Supporters
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects

3. **Screen 3 - Get Started:**
   - Headline: "Ready to get started?"
   - Call-to-action for wallet connection
   - Final step before main app

### Method 3: Force Onboarding Mode

localStorage.setItem('credvault-onboarding-completed', 'false');
location.reload();
```
