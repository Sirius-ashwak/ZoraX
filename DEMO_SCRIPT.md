## Opening Hook (30 seconds)

### Opening Statement
*[Confident, energetic tone]*

"What if creators could build verifiable reputation while supporters could discover high-quality projects before they go viral? Today I'm excited to show you **CredVault** - a platform that's transforming the creator economy by making trust transparent and success viral."

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Responses

**Q: How does ZoraCred scoring work exactly?**
A: "It's a weighted algorithm: 40% volume, 25% supporters, 20% consistency, 15% engagement. All data is on-chain and verifiable. We're planning to open-source the algorithm for complete transparency."

**Q: What's your competitive advantage over existing platforms?**
A: "Three things: First, our reputation system creates network effects - better creators attract more supporters. Second, Farcaster integration provides native viral distribution. Third, we're building on Zora's proven infrastructure rather than reinventing the wheel."

**Q: How do you plan to acquire creators and supporters?**
A: "We're starting with high-quality creators who value reputation building. Each successful creator becomes a case study that attracts more creators. For supporters, our Frame sharing creates organic discovery."

**Q: What's your revenue model?**
A: "2.5% platform fee on successful campaigns, plus potential revenue from premium analytics, advanced features, and partnerships. We're aligned with creator success."

**Q: How does this integrate with Zora specifically?**
A: "We use Zora CoinV4 for token deployment, Zora's metadata standards for NFTs, and we're building hooks for future Zora protocol updates. It's deep integration, not just surface-level usage."

**Q: What about gas fees and user experience?**
A: "We're on Optimism, so gas fees are typically under $0.50. For onboarding, we're exploring gasless transactions and credit card payments to reduce friction."
